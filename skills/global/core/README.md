# Core

Stack-agnostic foundations - review lenses, reasoning, testing, simplification, agent-legible repos, comments, design patterns, skill authoring, and AI-writing cleanup.

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`do-adversarial-review`](./do-adversarial-review/) | Adversarially hunt for correctness bugs and regressions in a change set. |
| [`do-agent-docs`](./do-agent-docs/) | Make a repository legible to coding agents. |
| [`do-architecture-md`](./do-architecture-md/) | Generate an ARCHITECTURE.md file for a codebase following matklad's principles. |
| [`do-behavioral-testing`](./do-behavioral-testing/) | Behavioral testing methodology — test what users experience, not how code is structured. |
| [`do-code-comments`](./do-code-comments/) | Write high-signal code comments for humans and coding agents. |
| [`do-design-patterns-gof`](./do-design-patterns-gof/) | The 23 Gang of Four object-oriented design patterns (Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides, 1994) distilled as a practical field guide, not a catalog. |
| [`do-first-principles`](./do-first-principles/) | Physics-based reasoning framework (Musk methodology) that deconstructs a problem to irreducible fundamental truths, classifies every element as hard constraint, soft constraint, or assumption, then reconstructs the optimal solution from fundamentals alone. |
| [`do-humanize`](./do-humanize/) | Detect and rewrite AI-generated developer text. |
| [`do-red-team`](./do-red-team/) | Adversarial analysis deploying parallel expert agents to stress-test ideas, strategies, and plans — decomposes into atomic claims, attacks them, then steelmans and counter-argues, producing severity-ranked findings with remediation. |
| [`do-simplify`](./do-simplify/) | Simplify and refine recently modified code for clarity and consistency. |
| [`do-skill-craft`](./do-skill-craft/) | Authors Agent Skills: the vocabulary and principles that make a skill predictable, distillation of a blog post, article, documentation, GitHub repo, video transcript, book, or paper into a reusable skill, and review of PRs that add or modify Agent Skills for structural validity, design quality, and marketplace consistency. |
