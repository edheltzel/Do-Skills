## What it does

`do-show-me` makes the agent explain the current topic with compact visuals instead of walls of prose. It picks the smallest view that makes the point: pseudocode, a call tree, a component tree, a shallow file tree, a Mermaid diagram, a `diff` of any of those, or one focused HTML file when the idea is too dense for text.

It never fires on its own. You call it when a reply got too dense to read.

## When to reach for it

Type `/do-show-me` after a reply full of jargon, or before the agent writes code, to talk through the shape of the change: types, signatures, call stacks. It also helps when reviewing a large diff to decide what to dig into.

## Where it fits

A standalone you reach for anytime. [art](./art.md) makes polished static visuals for an audience. `do-show-me` makes quick working sketches for you, inside the conversation.
