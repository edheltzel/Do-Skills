## What it does

`do-humanize` scans developer text for AI-generated writing patterns and can apply the fixes it finds. Default mode writes `ai-writing-review.json` and does not rewrite files. `fix` mode consumes that report: safe findings are applied automatically, needs-review findings wait for confirmation.

Evidence comes before a flag. Every finding must cite file:line and pass the bundled verification protocol. `--dry-run` previews proposed text edits. The skill will not stash. If `git status --porcelain` shows anything other than untracked `ai-writing-review.json`, fix mode stops.

## When to reach for it

You invoke this by typing `/do-humanize`. The agent won't reach for it on its own.

Reach for review when text sounds like ChatGPT, or you want a writing-quality pass before merge: `/do-humanize [--all] [--category <name>] [path]`. Reach for fix after that JSON exists: `/do-humanize fix [--dry-run]`.

## Prerequisites

Fix mode needs `ai-writing-review.json` from a review run in this skill, or `--all` so fix mode runs review itself first. A dirty worktree other than that untracked report stops the edit pass.

## Review, then fix

The skill partitions files into prose, code docs, and git, then checks six pattern categories (content, vocabulary, formatting, communication, filler, code docs). Safe vs needs-review is classified up front so fix mode can auto-apply only the mechanical ones.

**Safe** means mechanical: delete a chat leak, swap a listed filler phrase, drop an emoji. **Needs review** means a rewrite that could change meaning: promotional language, tautological docs, structure. Git artifacts (commits, PRs) are never auto-fixed.

## It's working if

- Review: `ai-writing-review.json` parses and `git_head` matches `HEAD`, or the run exited with no files to scan. Each finding has file:line, a category, and a fix-safety label. False positives listed in the skill (intentional formality, licenses, generated code) are not flagged.
- Fix: `--dry-run` lists the same partitions and does not stash. A normal review-then-fix run leaves `ai-writing-review.json` readable after preflight (G1 allows that untracked file and nothing else). Applied files pass the skill's per-type validation. Failures are checked out and not listed as OK. Success deletes `ai-writing-review.json`. A failed validation keeps that file.

## Where it fits

A user-invoked detection and rewrite pass in Slop Guard. Review feeds fix inside the same skill. [tech-writing](../workflow/tech-writing.md) is the voice to write with in the first place. This skill audits and cleans what already landed.
