## What it does

`do-gh-stack` manages an ordered stack of branches and pull requests with the `gh stack` GitHub CLI extension. Each branch is based on the branch below it, so each pull request shows only that layer's diff to its reviewer.

Its defining constraint is linearity: a branch has one parent and at most one child, with foundational work at the bottom and dependent work above it.

## When to reach for it

Type `/do-gh-stack`, or the agent reaches for it automatically when work needs stacked branches, dependent pull requests, or a checked-out stack.

Reach for it before beginning multi-part work, when editing the layer that owns a change, or when creating, submitting, syncing, rebasing, merging, or checking out a stack. For one local commit, use [Commit](../workflow/commit.md); to commit and publish a single branch without a stack, use [Commit and Push](../workflow/commit-push.md).

## Prerequisites

Install the `github/gh-stack` extension. Enable Git's `rerere` support, and configure `remote.pushDefault` when the repository has more than one remote.

## Non-interactive stack control

`gh stack` changes behavior when stdout is a TTY, so this workflow uses explicit non-interactive commands rather than bare interactive ones. Read stack state with `gh stack view --json`; submit with `gh stack submit --auto`; and use named targets for operations such as checkout and merge.

When a stack changes below the current layer, rebase the branches above it with `gh stack rebase --upstack`. Use `gh stack sync` to reconcile the local stack with GitHub, rebase it, push it, and refresh pull-request state.

## Where it fits

Use this to shape related changes into reviewable PR layers, not as a replacement for an ordinary commit workflow. [Commit](../workflow/commit.md) covers a local Conventional Commit, and [Commit and Push](../workflow/commit-push.md) covers committing and pushing a single branch.
